NAVIGATION
  - Think about: how should you handle the case when you leave the page while studying a list
    - should you release the memory
    - should you just remember where you are ?? 


ADDING WORD
  - BUG: why is the list in memory and the new word is only written to disk, but 
    does not apprear in the list in the browser



MODIFYING WORD
  - Create a new page for it
    - Proceed with this only after you are fully ready with adding words
    - Proceed with this only after you have finalized the json format
    - Use the value property in html to autofill the form
    - Browser path must be sth like /modifyword/<word>

  - Create new flask functions and paths for this
  - Add button for doing this while browsing words

  - Make sure that you modify every entry in EVERY LIST

  - Add a way for removing the word from its current lists 
    - again not active for the default lists
    - this will change the format of the json you send



REVIEWING WORDS
  - Add a way to directly add the word to another list
  - Must be also able to create a new list
  - Add a way for removing the word from the current list - again not active for the default lists



JSON FORMAT:
  - Add a synonyms/antonyms entry to a card ?
  - What other fields would you need


IMPROVEMENTS
  - make a button after learning a list to try it again - not crucial
  - see log.md and fix the relevant words
  - make KNOW and DON'T KNOW signs when displaying a word colored
