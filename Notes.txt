FINAL:
  - Check log.md and do the necessary changes

BUGS:
  - word options - currently able to add word to its current list


NAVIGATION
  - Think about: how should you handle the case when you leave the page while studying a list
    - should you release the memory
    - should you just remember where you are ?? 


MODIFYING WORD
  - Should there be a button to delete word from all lists ???


IMPROVEMENTS
  - make a button after learning a list to try it again - not crucial


  REMOVING WORD
    - After removing append the list to the displayed lists so that you can add the word back if a mistake
    - Same after adding
