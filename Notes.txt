NAVIGATION
  - Make sure that addword and search get open in new tabs so that you don't lose track of the current list
  - Think about: how should you handle the case when you leave the page while studying a list
    - should you release the memory
    - should you just remember where you are ?? 


ADDING WORD
  - Add a field for choosing which list to add the word to

  - Check if it already exists and send appropriate message as response
    - message must be in json format
    - js must parse the message (string to json)
    - js must report properly to user what happened

  - Make sure you also add the word to the all list
  - Make sure you can only add to new lists and not to the default ones
    - how do you make a form with several selections possible


  - BUG: why is the list in memory and the new word is only written to disk, but 
    does not apprear in the list in the browser



MODIFYING WORD
  - Create a new page for it
    - Proceed with this only after you are fully ready with adding words
    - Proceed with this only after you have finalized the json format
    - Use the value property in html to autofill the form
    - Browser path must be sth like /modifyword/<word>

  - Create new flask functions and paths for this
  - Add button for doing this while browsing words

  - Make sure that you modify every entry in EVERY LIST

  - Add a way for removing the word from its current lists 
    - again not active for the default lists
    - this will change the format of the json you send



REVIEWING WORDS
  - Add a way to directly add the word to another list
  - Must be also able to create a new list
  - Add a way for removing the word from the current list - again not active for the default lists



JSON FORMAT:
  - Add a synonyms/antonyms entry to a card ?
  - What other fields would you need


SEARCHING FOR A WORD
  - Check in python how to match a string to all dictionary keys
  - Maybe use a dedicated page rather than the thing on the navbar


IMPROVEMENTS
  - make a button after learning a list to try it again - not crucial
  - another page for creating a new list ?

  - see log.md and fix the relevant words
