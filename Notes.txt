NAVIGATION
  - Think about: how should you handle the case when you leave the page while studying a list
    - should you release the memory
    - should you just remember where you are ?? 


ADDING WORD
  - BUG: why is the list in memory and the new word is only written to disk, but 
    does not apprear in the list in the browser



MODIFYING WORD
  - Handle the note thing about word having other meanings
  - Add button for doing this while browsing words
  - Should there be a button to delete word from all lists ???


DISPLAYING WORD
  - Don't display KNOW/DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU ACCESS A WORD VIA LINK OR SEARCH


JSON FORMAT:
  - Add a synonyms/antonyms entry to a card ?
  - What other fields would you need


IMPROVEMENTS
  - make a button after learning a list to try it again - not crucial
  - see log.md and fix the relevant words


  REMOVING WORD
    - After removing append the list to the displayed lists so that you can add the word back if a mistake
    - Same after adding
